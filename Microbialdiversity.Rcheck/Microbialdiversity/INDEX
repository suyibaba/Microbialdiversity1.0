Microbialdiversity      Microbialdiversity: A package for calculating
                        microbial diversity indices
calculate_inverse_simpson
                        Calculate Inverse Simpson Diversity Index
calculate_observed_otus
                        Calculate Observed OTUs
calculate_shannon       Calculate Shannon Diversity Index
calculate_simpson       Calculate Simpson Diversity Index This function
                        calculates the Simpson diversity index (1-D)
                        for a vector of species counts or proportions.
                        The Simpson index ranges from 0 (low diversity)
                        to 1 (high diversity).
